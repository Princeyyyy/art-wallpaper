# 🎨 ArtWallpaper Manager v3.0.0

> Because staring at the same wallpaper for months is like eating the same breakfast for a year - technically possible, but why would you do that to yourself?

Turn your desktop into a daily art gallery! I built this because I got tired of looking at the same mountain landscape every day (sorry mountain, it's not you, it's me). Now my desktop transforms itself with beautiful curated artwork, and my productivity has skyrocketed by at least 3%* 

*Results may vary. Side effects may include frequent distractions due to stunning artwork.

## 🌟 What's New in 3.0?

- 🚀 **Fixed Auto-Start**: Finally, it actually starts with Windows! (We mean it this time!)
- 🎨 **Better Icons**: Fresh new application icon for that professional look
- ⚡ **Installation Path Fix**: Properly installs where it should (no more hide and seek!)
- 🛠️ **Technical Improvements**: Under-the-hood fixes for better reliability
- 🎯 **Same Great Features**: All the stuff you love, just working better

## ✨ Features That Make You Go "Ooooh"

- 🎨 Daily Art Delivery: Fresh artwork served daily, like a fancy art subscription but free!
- 🕒 Time Lord Mode: Pick exactly when your wallpaper changes! Want new art with your morning coffee at 9:00? Done. Midnight art swap? You got it!
- 💾 Offline Mode: Because sometimes the internet needs a vacation (works offline like a champ)
- 🔄 Previous/Next Navigation: Don't like what you see? Swipe left! (well, click left, but you get the idea)
- 🖼️ High-Quality Only: No pixelated nonsense here - we're not living in 1995
- 🎯 Clean UI: Because life is complicated enough without a confusing interface
- 🎬 No Repeats: Like your favorite DJ, we don't play the same track twice
- 📅 Smart Scheduling: Set it and forget it - until you're blown away by tomorrow's masterpiece
- 🗂️ History Tracking: We remember every artwork, so you don't have to
