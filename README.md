# 🎨 ArtWallpaper Manager v3.2.0

> Because staring at the same wallpaper for months is like eating the same breakfast for a year - technically possible, but why would you do that to yourself?

Turn your desktop into a daily art gallery! I built this because I got tired of looking at the same mountain landscape every day (sorry mountain, it's not you, it's me). Now my desktop transforms itself with beautiful curated artwork, and my productivity has skyrocketed by at least 3%* 

*Results may vary. Side effects may include frequent distractions due to stunning artwork.
