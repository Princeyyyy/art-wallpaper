# 🎨 ArtWallpaper Manager

> Because staring at the same wallpaper for months should be considered a crime against creativity.

I built this because I got tired of looking at the same mountain landscape every day (you know the one). Now my desktop changes automatically with beautiful artwork from Unsplash, and my productivity has increased by at least 3% (results may vary).

## ✨ Features That Spark Joy

- 🎨 Automatic wallpaper rotation (because decision fatigue is real)
- 🕒 24-hour refresh cycle (customization coming soon!)
- 💾 Smart caching (works offline, because internet isn't forever)
- 🔄 Previous/Next navigation (for when the algorithm picks something your cat doesn't like)
- 🖼️ High-quality processing (no more pixelated monstrosities)
- 🎯 Clean UI (because life is complicated enough)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Java 17+ (Java 17-23 supported)
- Windows OS (Mac users, we still love you, but from a distance for now)
- Internet connection (for fresh artwork)
- A desire for change in your life

### Quick Start
1. Head to [Releases](https://github.com/Princeyyyy/art-wallpaper/releases/tag/untagged-1f6b94a3a1925a249caa) and grab the latest `.msi` installer
   (it's the one that says `ArtWallpaper-1.0.0.msi` - fancy, right?)
2. Double-click that bad boy and follow the installer
   (Yes, it's that simple. No, there's no catch)
3. Launch ArtWallpaper from your Start Menu
   (Auto-start is coming soon™, for now you'll have to exercise those clicking muscles)

## 🎮 Usage

Lives quietly in your system tray (right-click for all the goodies):
- "New Wallpaper" (for the impatient)
- "Settings" (coming soon™)
- "Exit" (but why would you?)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- ⚠️ Settings panel is currently taking a vacation (fix coming soon!)
- 🚫 Windows auto-start isn't working yet (we're teaching it to be more of a morning person)
- 🍎 Mac support is still dreaming (Windows-only for now, sorry Apple fans!)
- Default settings are locked at:
  - 24-hour rotation cycle
  - Notifications enabled
  - Full-screen wallpaper mode
- Settings changes won't stick around (they're commitment-phobic for now)

## 🛠️ Building from Source

```bash
./gradlew build
```
(It's not rocket science, but it's honest work)

## 📁 Where's My Stuff?

Everything lives in `%USERPROFILE%/.artwallpaper/`:
- `artworks/` - The good stuff
- `cache/` - Temporary stuff (gets deleted so relax your storage won't get cooked)
- `metadata/` - Stuff about stuff (you know, real nerd stuff)
